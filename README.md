# To-Do List Project

This project is a boilerplate designed to help beginners get started with a full-stack application using **React** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. The project provides a basic structure for implementing a To-Do List application with user authentication and CRUD operations for tasks. However, it is not fully implemented, and completing the project by adding missing features and refining functionality is essential for practice and learning.


## Features

### Frontend (React)

- User-friendly interface built with React.
- Authentication with JWT.
- Task management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### Backend (Django)

- RESTful API built with Django Rest Framework.
- JWT-based authentication.
- Database integration for managing tasks and users.


## Installation Guides

### Frontend Setup

Follow the [Frontend Setup Guide](./ui/README.md) to install and run the React application.

### Backend Setup

Follow the [Backend Setup Guide](./api/README.md) to install and run the Django server.
